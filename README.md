# Entry Level for Craft CMS 5


**Allows for the automatic placing of new entries to a desired Structure level.**

This plugin will nest a new entry based on the Entry Type.  No more manually repositioning entries after save!

Mostly for those using the [Entry Type Templates pattern](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/entry-type-templates) to create landing pages with children (e.g., blogs with articles).

## Requirements

- Craft CMS 5.3.0+
- PHP 8.2+

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require "martinsmith/craft-entry-level" -w && php craft plugin/install entry-level
```

```bash
ddev composer require "martinsmith/craft-entry-level" -w && ddev craft plugin/install entry-level
```

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Plugins → Entry Level → Settings**
2. For each Structure section, configure parent-child relationships between Entry Types

## How It Works

When you create a new entry of a configured "child" Entry Type, the plugin automatically moves that entry under a parent entry of the configured "parent" Entry Type.

### Example: News Section

```
Entry Types:
├── News Landing (root level)
└──- News Article (parent: News Landing)
```

With this configuration:
- Creating a **News Landing** → stays at root level (no parent configured)
- Creating a **News Article** → automatically placed under **News Landing**

### Multi-Level Hierarchies

The plugin supports unlimited nesting depth. Chain Entry Types to create deep structures:

| Entry Type | Parent Type | Result |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Landing Page | (none) | Root level |
| Article | (Landing Page) | Level 2 |


## Technical Details

- Uses `Entry::EVENT_AFTER_PROPAGATE` to ensure the correct Entry Type is detected
- Moves entries using Craft's `StructuresService::append()` for proper hierarchy management
- Only affects new entries at level 1 (root level)
- Respects manually positioned entries (won't override existing parents)
- Settings are stored in Project Config for environment sync

## Troubleshooting

### Entry not being auto-parented

1. Check that the parent Entry Type has at least one entry created
2. Verify the configuration in Settings → Plugins → Entry Level
3. Ensure you're creating a new entry (editing existing entries won't trigger auto-parenting)

### Wrong parent being selected

Try changing the Parent Selection strategy:
- Use **Specific Entry** if you need precise control
- Use **First Created** for stable, predictable behavior
- Use **Most Recently Updated** for dynamic selection
